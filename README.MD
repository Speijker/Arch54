### ARCH LINUX INSTALL NOTES

I made this for myself, to keep track of how I like to install my arch linux system.

Oftentimes I break something irrepairably, and will need to do a clean install. This is so I don't forget what I did so I can get back to my own system quickly.

! This is a work in progress, so I will return occasionaly to tweak it if I think something else works better.
